This was to find an error during searching order numbers based on a given list that was suspected to cause it. 
This allowed me to focus on my other work while I knew this task was being handled. 

Found the error on the second lunch day 

TO RUN:
1. Install the required packages using pip
2. Set up a virtual environment (if needed)
3. run python file
